Written Report

Looking at the data it can be seen that the highest performing scholls based on passing % was charter schools. Some interesting facts that go along with this is that the total school budget and budget per student is lower in charter schools than district schools. The total number of students is also a significant difrerence between charter and distrcit schools. 

Another interesting analysis is that the amount of money a school spends on students has an inverse relationship to grades. I think this is due to the fact that charter schools spend the least on students abd they ususally have requirments/application to get into the school, so they only accept the "best and brightest" students. ANother inference I made is that most people that go to charter schools have the resources to hire outside tutors for classes, which doesnt count toward the amoint of money the school spends on the students education.

The size of the student body didnt seem to have a difference from samll to medium, but had a big impact from medium to large. This could be because of the ratio between students and teachers, but that data was not included so in this dataset.

School type does seem to have a difference in student test results and passing rate, this can be for multiple reasons that this data set does not include. I infer its because of student to teacher ratio, along with outside access to tutors which dont fall into the school budget per student.
